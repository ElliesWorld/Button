Test and develop a single-instance module to debounce a push button.

    Use TDD and dual targeting strategy to test and develop the button module.
    To build and run the test use make.
    When there are 5 consecutive states of the same value the state of the button is stable and reliable.
    The module should detect RELEASED and PRESSED debounced states.
    The module should be able to detect debounced RISING and FALLING edges.
    An edge is a unique event and it is to be readable only once.

    Connect a push button to pin 34 of ESP32.
    Using a timer interrupt, call the update function of the button module every 2 ms to update the debounced state of the button.
    When the button is pressed, on the falling edges of the button, print “Falling edge” to the terminal.
